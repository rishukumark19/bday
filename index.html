hey ! many many happy returns of the day , hope u are well. and haha , i can imagine u must have planned smth this year as well ahaha. smth new maybe . i kinda missed u a lot to be honest , not like i am crazy bout u yk . ahah well i remember since it was new year , i was moving all the files from phone to laptop , clearing out space , and i could literally remember me telling u how dumb u are, cant even move ur files lol , so i was remembering other things as well ahaha. well yk i recently made a post on insta as well , so i planned on adding smth close to ur reference , idk y i wanted to do that , but yaa , i added a pic , u remember we were in udupi beach and u were clicking my pics , and few pics were of those shades which were there on the beach , so yaa i added that as well , cause yk , it was a sun kissed pic . ahaha. and again recently , yk i have been going to reliance fresh lately , and literally . so i have this habit of converting prices to unit , and ughhh it just sparks my head instantly . like it literally reminds me of u da . If I am sending this as text ! Tell me 680/5 (fyi that’s the price of 5kg surf excel I was checking out today lol, fyi 1 kg packet comes cheaper than 5kg packet Ahmm)

Well few days ago I was talking to myself what I will say to u , and the only thing that came to my mind was , no matter what our present is or whatever will be the future , I live with u da ! I enjoyed every moment , if I close my eyes I can recall so many memories , and it’s never gonna be blurry cause I can literally remember every single moment I had with u , every single memory holds a different story , a different craziness , and while I am typing this I can literally name each of them and I can clearly remember what we did in each and every time we spent together. Everything feels like a chapter of our book . Thats the most amazing gift I could have received from anyone . Once again many many happy return of the day ! Stay sexy !

Yours dumbass!
